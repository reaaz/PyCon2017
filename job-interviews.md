# Rants from a Job Applicant after 100 CS Job Interviews in Silicon Valley by Susan Tan
## 6 Things I Hated About the Process

1. No feedback of any kind - not hearing back from company after interview
2. Don't waste my time
3. Ask me a stupid question (ex: Biz Stone with a single interview question about what you want to accomplish in your life)
4. [Someone asked her to code an entire Ruby application from scratch when she didn't know Ruby]
5. Low-ball salary offer (way below the average for the area), candidate should be more truthful with salary on call with recruiter initial phone screen
6. Take-home code challenge
   * no time constraint, no feedback, unpaid labor
   * 3-4 job positions: 18-32 hours total
   * doesn't fit job description
   * wrong programming language
   * algorithms-heavy [was more applicable to a new college grad than a mid-senior level engineer]

## Good Things
* Sending an outline of what will be tested at each interview, which engineers will be present, and what to expect before an on-site
